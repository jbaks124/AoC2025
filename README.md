## 🎄 What is Advent of Code 2025

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2025) (AoC) is an annual coding event: each December, a set of holiday-themed programming puzzles is released. From 2025 onwards, the format has been updated: there will be **12 days of puzzles** (instead of the former 25). :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

Solving each puzzle earns you “stars” — one per part of a puzzle — which makes it a fun challenge and a good way to sharpen your coding skills, experiment with different languages, or build up a personal code archive. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}
